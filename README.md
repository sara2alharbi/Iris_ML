The Iris dataset is widely recognized within the machine learning community, comprising 150 instances of iris flowers, each characterized by 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target variable indicating the iris species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

In conclusion:
- Logistic Regression is a strong baseline: The Logistic Regression model achieved high accuracy (98.33%) on the testing data without any tuning. This suggests that it is a good starting point for classification tasks in this domain.
- Hyperparameter tuning improves accuracy: All models showed improvement in accuracy after hyperparameter tuning. This indicates that tuning the models' parameters is essential for getting the best performance.
- Support Vector Machine is the best individual model: After tuning, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy (98.89%) among the individual models. This suggests that SVM is the most effective model for this specific task.
- Ensemble model: The ensemble model did not achieve a higher accuracy than the tuned SVM model, but it achieved higher accuracy than the individual SVM model before tuning.
